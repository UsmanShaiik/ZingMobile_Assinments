# Node.js with MySQL Example

This repository provides a basic example of using Node.js with MySQL. It demonstrates how to set up a Node.js project, install dependencies, and interact with a MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - Database management system

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-mysql-example.git
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase;
USE mydatabase;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    section VARCHAR(1),
    subject_marks JSON,
    collegeId INT
);
module.exports = {
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_mysql_username',
    password: 'your_mysql_password',
    database: 'mydatabase'
};

Replace `"your-username"` with your GitHub username in the clone URL, and `"your_mysql_username"` and `"your_mysql_password"` with your MySQL credentials in the `config.js` file.

This `README.md` provides clear instructions on how to install Node.js, set up the project, configure MySQL, and run the application. It also includes information on accessing the application and licensing details.
